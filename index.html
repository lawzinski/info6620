                <p><i>The next line of numbered spaces represents the measure – the ideal line
                        length for reading, which as we read last week should be in the range of 45
                        to 85 characters. So, ideally the line should break somewhere in the range
                        of red characters...</i></p>

                    click around the links that you will find here to learn more about my design and
                    development background, skills, process, portfolio, and experience. Feel free to

                <h3>My background - 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10...</h3>
                <p>I am not a professional web designer or trained developer. However, I have
                    extensive experience in related fields and was awarded merit-based scholarship
                    and worked as a graduate assistant my time at university. </p>
                <p>I take inspiration from <abbr title="Sam Beckett"></abbr>SB Beckett’s
                        <cite>Trilogy</cite>: </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p> The fact would seem to be, if in my situation one may speak of facts, not
                        only that I shall have to speak of things of which I cannot speak, but also,
                        which is even more interesting, but also that I, which is if possible even
                        more interesting, that I shall have to, I forget, no matter. <br /> (Samuel
                        Beckett) </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>See also the resources on <a href="http://www.samuel-beckett.net/">Samuel Beckett
                        Online Resources Page</a></p>
                <p>If I were to point to one thing that really sets it apart from everyone else in
                    the world would be my ability to remember the things that are important and
                    forget the things really bug me.</p>
                <p>My favourite numbers are 1, 32, 43, 44, 56, 77 and 149502.</p>
                <h3>My Process</h3>
                <p> Over the years, I have developed a thorough process for the analysis, design,
                    and creation of material being posted on the web. In my process, I take the
                    following steps: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Identify</strong> – to ensure that both the needs and the
                        expectations of the client are met</li>
                    <li><strong>Investigate</strong> – in-depth research, exploration and
                        examination of the client’s needs</li>
                    <li><strong>Integrate</strong> – determining the project’s place within the
                        overall marketing strategy of the client</li>
                    <li><strong>Illustrate</strong> – draft and display and revise sample layouts
                        and interfaces</li>
                </ol>
